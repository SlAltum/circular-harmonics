# Shape Description
In time `t` and radius `θ`, we have point `(x,y)` in envelope depicted as:
```
x = x_0(t) + ρ(θ+φ(t)) * cos(θ)
y = y_0(t) + ρ(θ+φ(t)) * sin(θ)
```
where `x_0` and `y_0` is the centroid coordinate in time `t`, and `φ` is the rotation respectively. The motion within time slot `τ` depicted as:
```
x_0(t+τ) = x_0(t) + v_x * τ
y_0(t+τ) = y_0(t) + v_y * τ
φ(t+τ) = φ(t) + ω * τ
```
